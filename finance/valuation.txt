Valuation is a craft
- a skill you learn by doing
- like cooking
- a bridge between stories and numbers
- a disciplined storyteller and a imaginative number cruncher


Value vs Price:
Value - driven by Cash flows, growth, and risk
Price - driven by Demand and Supply (Demand/Supply could be driven by mood, revenge, momentum)
Behavioural Finance can't affect the value of a company, but it can affect its price.

Some things cannot be valued, but can be priced - art, bitcoin, currency


Biases and Preconceptions:

Know what is your initial view, try to address it.


Myths about Valuation:
1. Valuation is an objective search for "true" value
    - how much bias and in which direction?
2. Valuation provides a precise estimate of value
    - the payoff is greatest when the valuation is least precise
3. The more quantitative a model, the better the valuation
    - less is more
    - simpler models do much better
    - it is easy to hide garbage in complex models
    - when in doubt, aggregate
    
    
Approaches to Valuation:
1. Intrinsic Valuation - based on capacity to generate cash flows and the risk in the cash flows
2. Relative Valuation or Pricing - estimates how much to pay for an asset based on what others are paying for comparable assets, scaled to a common metric
3. Real option (contingent claim) valuation - augments the value of assets for which cash flows are contingent on an event happening


Efficient markets would leave no space for valuation
- markets make mistakes, assume this before starting with valuation
- market corrects itself


Intrinsic Valuation:
Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)

- estimate life of an asset
- estimate cash flows during the life of the asset
- estimate discount rate to get present value

suited for investors who:
- have a long time horizon
- can provide the catalyst needed to move the price to value
- are not easily swayed


Relative Valuation (Pricing)

- a group of companies
- a standardized (comparable) metric
- control for any differences from the group of company

- corrections in pricing are faster than corrections in valuation
- with pricing, something is always cheap (below average of the industry)
- the world is a pricing world

suited when:
- large number of comparable assets
- time horizons are short


Options Pricing Model:
- stretching the options pricing model, used to value exchange traded options
- patents, etc.
- value of option increases with (downside) risk


Equity Valuation vs Business Valuation





Corporate examples:

Netflix vs Spotify:
Netflix - pays license upfront
Spotify - pays based on number of streams
